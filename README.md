### improvement to the original software:

1.modulize.
now you can add more modules to make it work on more websites.
2.fix some bugs that makes the original software can only push 365 days's data.
now it can push as much as you wish.

### be careful:

the software is very slow.I know nothing about android,so I could hardly make it faster.
Be patient.
and advised to use it under wifi.seems it works badly at mobile network.
